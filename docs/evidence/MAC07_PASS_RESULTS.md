# MAC07 pass evidence register

**State: PARTIAL REPRODUCTION; AUDIO/HARDWARE ACCEPTANCE BLOCKED.** Do not store private filenames, absolute paths, music, or media hashes here. Baseline source: `e9cacb1d8d1a3464fd1ba973449767f7152cffd1` on `build/native-codecs-g0`.

| Pass | Source / commands | Observation | Result / blocker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MAC07-00 | Same-file CLI attempts; Sound settings; CoreAudio default-device probe | CLI failed twice at `AudioQueueStart` with `-66680` (`kAudioQueueErr_InvalidDevice`). Sound settings showed MacBook Air Speakers selected, but an independent idle CoreAudio query returned default device ID 0 and a zero-length device list. | **BLOCKED / PARTIAL.** No output device is exposed through CoreAudio while idle; GUI audibility remains unverified. |
| MAC07-01 | Persistent-server `CountingSink` regression for all 11 supplied FLACs; fresh bundled GUI and direct CLI after explicit default-route binding | 11/11 FLACs passed decode/frame delivery to the counting test sink; this does not test native output. Before the fix, GUI `CurrentDevice` did not match the default UID. After the fix, the GUI record showed route status 0, device status 0, associated device matching default, 1,059 buffers / 271,104 frames, 1,059 callbacks, completed drain, stop 0, dispose 0. A same-file CLI attempt failed route binding with `-66680` before allocating buffers or submitting frames. The idle CoreAudio query still showed default ID 0 and no devices. | **IN PROGRESS / UNVERIFIED.** GUI route binding succeeds during app playback; CLI route binding fails in this environment. The operator's latest GUI audibility response is pending. Do not infer sound from route match, callbacks, or frames. |
| MAC07-02 | No acceptance run recorded | GUI frame count alone is not validated against audible device output; telemetry/parser work is underway. | **NOT VERIFIED.** Depends on MAC07-01 acceptance. |
| MAC07-03 | No acceptance run recorded | No compact/expanded layout or keyboard acceptance recorded for this pass. | **NOT RUN.** |
| MAC07-04 | No acceptance run recorded | No audible queue transition or operator transport acceptance recorded. | **NOT RUN.** |
| MAC07-05 | No acceptance run recorded | No playlist/persistence/path-safety acceptance recorded. | **NOT RUN.** |
| MAC07-06 | No acceptance run recorded | No A/B run, UX pilots, or acoustic evidence recorded. | **NOT RUN.** |
| MAC07-07 | Documentation synchronization only | Roadmap and task routing were updated; release gate, app/hardware acceptance and independent safety review are not implied. | **NOT COMPLETE.** |

## Interpretation

The direct CLI route-binding error and CoreAudio's idle absence of a default/enumerated device remain relevant. Sound settings show the built-in speakers selected. The GUI can bind its queue UID to the default during playback, while a direct CLI attempt cannot bind in the same environment. Neither a route match nor successful callbacks prove sound. The 11/11 `CountingSink` result is decoder/frame-delivery evidence only. No MAC07 audio, hardware, or production acceptance pass is recorded.

## Remaining acceptance sequence

Restore a CoreAudio-visible output device, rerun the direct CLI and GUI, and confirm both bind to the selected default and produce audible sound. Investigate why idle CoreAudio enumeration returns no devices while the GUI can bind during playback. Then validate progress/state, layout, transport, playlists, and A/B behavior. Capture sanitized commands, source SHA, and operator audibility confirmation. Run release checks at the accepted candidate; retain hardware/device and distribution blockers until separately observed.
